<!-- Makes sure votes aren't visible unless a user is logged in. It checks to see if we can
create a vote. Since you can only create a vote
when logged in(see votes_controller when @vote 
create an @vote instance variable when there is 
a current_user.id, it can't create a vote instance when a register user is not present, thus you can only view votes when a
user is logged in. Note that nothing is needed
in the vote policy. The checking is done in the vote controller.-->
